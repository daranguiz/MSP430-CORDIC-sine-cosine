This project contains a function to caluculate sine and cosine using CORDIC 
rotation on a 16 bit MSP430. The function takes any angle in degrees and 
outputs the answers in Q.15 fixed point format.
(floating point) = (fixed point)/ 2^15

In creating this file, I referenced the 2004 presentation of Fixed Point Two's 
Complement CORDIC Arithmetic on MSP430 presentation by Titi Trandafir of 
Microtrend Systems which contained an assembly language program utilizing 
CORDIC. I also referenced the CORDIC wikipedia page.

The function internally utilizes the following decimal angle representation:
(decimal angle) = 2^16 * (integer angle in degrees) / 180

I tested the function using 14 iterations and achieve accuracy to 3-4 decimal
places. On an 8MHz chip, the algorithm took 256us to calculate sine/cosine for
angles in the range greater than -180 to 180 degrees. If you constrain the input
angles to -45 to 45 degrees and remove all the logic for greater angles, the 
CORDIC iterations are finished in 178us.

The file "MSP430 CORDIC Accuracy.xlsx" is a dump of the results of the algorithm
for angles in the range of -90 to 90.
